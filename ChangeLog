	  extension in lib rather than ext.

2008-06-12 00:04  Rocky Bernstein

2008-04-11 02:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* Verify that the 'else' doesn't appear in a trace.

2008-01-27 04:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* Was not showing blocks after when's.

2008-01-27 04:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* trace_nums.c, block1.c, block2.c: bug in handling blocks
	  lnum-diag.rb: more graceful about not finding the source.
	  if4.rb: note weirdness in the way comparison works.

2008-01-24 13:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* Need recursion in more places because of block continuation

	  Add nodes needed so we don't complain about rcov-bug.rb:
	  NODE_MATCH3, NODE_LASN, and NODE_STR (and those similar to that).

2008-01-24 04:09  Rocky Bernstein

	  getting
	  the trace line numbers is going remove a lot of headaches down
	  the line.

	* Add trace_line_numbers to save/get line numbers which we can set
	  breakpoints
	  on.

2008-01-17 06:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add @@full2file_cache_key. getlines wasn't returning the right
	  value sometimes.
	  Make return from checkcache meaningful. Change return value of
	  upate_cache().

	  Add
	  option on clear_file_cache to clear out SCRIPT_LINES__ as well.
	  TESTS ARE NEEDED.
	  Update to version 0.2.

2008-01-14 03:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* Use SCRIPT_LINES__ if we can.

2007-12-09 17:17  Rocky Bernstein
